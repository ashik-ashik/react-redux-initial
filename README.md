# React Redux

This project was bootstrapped with [Visit Now](https://redux-emajon.netlify.app/).

## ðŸš€ Tech Stack

**Client:** React, Redux, CSS, SASS

**Server:** Node, Express, MongoDB

## Documentation:

 To work with existing project there need to install react-redux ``` npm i react-redux ``` and also need to install core redux ``` npm install redux ```.

 In this project I have installed some additional packages to maintain the project easily. To maintain routes I have used React Router DOM ``` npm install react-router-dom```. For icons React-Icons ``` npm install react-icon```, and CSS pre-processor SASS ``` npm install sass```.

### `File structure:`
 After installation necessary packages I need to stand and ***FOLDER*** structure. Here, one think should take in mind that I will create ***GLOBAL*** contexts. A standard ***FILE STRUCTURE*** link this:
 * [x] Create ***redux*** folder under the ***SRC*** folder;
 * [x] Under the ***redux*** folder I should create a JS file for ***global store***, such as **``` store.js```**;
 * [x] Under the ***redux*** folder I should create a folder called ***reducers*** for ***reducer functions***, where I can put multiple reducer functions;
 * [x] Under the ***reducers*** folder I should create a file/ multiple files if needed called task relevent  reducer, such as ***Product_Reducer.js***;
 * [x] Into the ***Product_Reducer.js*** file I have to write the ***initialState*** and set a initial value:
    ```js
    {test:"TEST"}
    ```
    and write ***reducer*** function. I know the ***reducer*** function takes ***two*** parameters called ***`Previous State`*** and ***`action`***. Here, in redux, the previous state do not get by default, rather I have to assign the ***initialState*** to reducer previous state parameter, and `return` necessary action and than ***export*** the reducer function.
 * [x] Back to the ```store.js``` and create a store. *import* ***createStore*** form **```redux```** and pass a ***reducer*** function as parameter: 
    ```js
    const store = createStore(productReducer);
    ```
    and export the `store`.
* [x] Okay store creation done. Now make this store available as a `global context`. For this **go** back to the ```App.js``` file and import ***Provider*** from *```react-redux```* and than wrap all *`components`* by the **Provider**:
  ```jsx
  <>
  <Provider store={store}>
    <BrowserRouter>
      <Routes>
        <Route path='/' element={<Home />} />
      </Route>
    </BrowserRouter>
  </Provider>
  </>
  ```
  and pass the *`store`* as `prop`.

* [x] Well, all done! Now use the data globally on my application. To use the `store` in any `component` I have to write a single line of code. Here *`react-redux`* provide us a `hook` called ```useSelector``` which return a `callBack` function. So I have to call that function inside the *`useSelector`* function like:
  ```js
  const state = useSelector((state)=>state);
  console.log(state);
  ```
  ### ***Output***:
  - - -
  ```js
  {test:"TEST"}
  ```
## ** Action Types File**
Action types file is simple `js` file. Which contain come variables. I should use this way to avoid typing mistakes whenever I will type same types several place. File look like:
```js
  //Create a file called actionTypes.js 
  //there are two ways
  //way one
  const actionTypes = () => {
    return {
      LOAD_DATA:"LOAD_DATA",
      DELETE_DATA:"DELETE_DATA",
      // ....
    };
  };

  // way two
  export const LOAD_DATA= 'LOAD_DATA';
  export const DELETE_DATA= 'DELETE_DATA';
  // ....
```
I should import these types whenever I use actionTypes in any files.


## **Action Creator Functions:**
To have a neat and clean code I should use `action creator function`. These function creates `reducer` function's action, that's why these are called `action creator function`. These are basically simple function which will return necessary object for `dispatch()`, it will define which action will take and provide necessary data(data takes as parameter where it is called). It will call inside a `dispatch()`. The function how look like and how execute:

**`actionCreator function look like`**
```js
export const loadData = (data) => {
  type: LOAD_DATA,
  payload: data
};
```
**`Execution Action creator function`**
```js
  useEffect(()=>{
    dispatch(loadData(data))
  },[]);
```


## `Redux DevTool Extention`
* [x] At first I need to add the *`redux dev tool extention`* on the browser. 
* [x] Now there is needed to install *redux dev tool extention* on the working react project as: 
  ```
  npm install --save @redux-devtools/extension
  ```
* [x] Now I can use `redux devtools extention` on my working project. To execute the extention it need to `import` on the `store.js` file as a function called `composeWithDevTools` and call the function. Like:
  ```js
  import { createStore } from 'redux';
  import { composeWithDevTools } from '@redux-devtools/extension';

  const store = createStore(reducer, composeWithDevTools());
  ```
* [x] All done! Now I can see how the state changes. It will be found at the `browser colsole` as **`Redux`**.


## Multi Reducer function:
If I have more than one reducer, What should I do to maintain or execute multi reducer?
`redux` always expect single reducer function as parameter. For this I have to create a `root reducer` function. Here redux provide me a function to combine multiple reducer to convert single one. So, I have to create a file suppose called `rootReducer.js` and write some code like:
  ```jsx
  import {combineReducers} from 'redux';
  //import necessary reducer functions;
  const rootReducer = combineReducers({
    cart: ProductReducer,
    filter: FilterReducer,
    //property name(should be relevent to reducer to understand easily): reducerFunction,
  });
  export default rootReducer;
  ```
  Now, bring a little bit change in the `store.js` file. When I have only one reducer, pass that reducer as parameter of `createStore()` function. Now instead of that I have to pass the `rootReducer`, that's it. Code at `store.js`:
  ```js
    const store = createStore(rootReducer);
  ```


## **Middleware**
Basically the term `middleware` denote interceptor. Which is executed between an action taking and that action execution. It works/executed after taking an action and just before the execution. Here, the middleware can change/modify data before it execution.
#### Where do use middleware? and how?
In **`React`** project the middleware have to set at `store.js` file as the second parameter of `createStore` function. The redux provides us a function for the middleware called `applyMiddleware`, I have to `import` the `applyMiddleware` function from the `redux` and send the middleware function as parameter. Similar with:
```js 
import {createStore, applyMiddleware} from 'redux';
const store = createStore(reducer, 
          applyMiddleware(middleware)
        );
```
But if I have a `redux-debtools-extention` there could be a little bit different **Syntax**. Here the middleware shoule be wrapped by the *`redux-devtools-extention`* function like:
```js
  const store = createStore(rootReducer, 
  composeWithDevTools(
    applyMiddleware(middleware)
    ));
```

### **How to wtire a custom MIDDLEWARE?**
To write a custom middleware I have to write an exceptional function called `curring function`. It is nothing but a function, but this function takes parameter as separate ways. ***Syntax*** like:
```js
const curringFunc = () => () => () => {
  //execution
};
```
There have three separate parameters and each parameter takes a certain values.
* [x] **First** parameter takes **`store`**, that means it will takes our global store and this will provide the previous state from the current taking action.
* [x] **`Second`** parameter takes a function and it can be said `next` function. Because this function determine what are going to next.
* [x] **`Third`** as the last or third parameter the curring function takes the `reducer action`.
* [x] From the curring function I have to return *`next`* function with having the `action` parameter.
* [x] Before return I can change or modify `action` as my wishes.
After all the `syntax` will look like:
```js
  const middleWareName = (store) => (next)=> (action)=> {
  console.log("Current State", store?.getState());
  console.log("Which action", action);

  return next(action);
};

export default middleWareName;
```
- **`To get the current state there need to use *getState()* function`**


## **REDUX-THUNK**
Basically `redux-thunk` is a kind of middleware function. **`Redux-Thunk`** is used to `fetch` data from the live server through `API`. To ***install redux-thunk*** use:
```
npm i redux-thunk
```
I should thunk directory/folder under the redux folder. A thunk function return a function which gets two parameters, **`First`** `dispatch` and `Second` on is `getState`. And this function is an *`async`* function. `Thunk` function can change or modify data before and after `fetch`. A `thunk` function look like:
#### **`GET Request Thunk Function`**(simple):
```js
  const thunkFunction = () => {
    return async(dispatch, getState) => {
      const res = await fetch(`https://your-api-link/actual-path`);
      const data = await res.json();

      if(data.length){
        dispatch(actionCreatorFunction(data));
      };
    };
  };
``` 
#### **`GET Reqiest Thunk Function`** (with error handle):
```js
const thunkFunction = () => {
  return async(dispatch, getState) => {
    dispatch(loader());
    try{
      const res = await fetch(`https://your-api-link/actual-path`);  
      const data = await res.json();

      if(data.length){
        dispatch(loadProducts(data));
      }else{
      }
      
    } catch (error){
      dispatch(errorDisplay('OOOOPs!! Failed to fetch Data!!!'));
    };
  };
};
```
**Note:** In above example, inside the `dispatch` function I called `loader()`, `loadProducts()` and `errorDisplay()` functions, these are actually **`actionCreator`** function.

#### **`POST Request Thunk Function:`**
```js
  const postProduct = () => {
  return async(dispatch, getState) => {
     try{
       const res = await fetch(`https://your-api-link/actual-path`, {
         method:"POST",
         headers:{
           'Content-Type':"application/json"
         },
         body: JSON.stringify(product)
       });
       const data = await res.json();

       if(data.acknowledged){
         dispatch(addProduct({
           _id: data.insertedId,
           ...product
         }));
       };
     }catch(err){
      dispatch(errorDisplay('Failed to Possst!!!'));
     }
  };
};
``` 
#### **`DELETE Request Thunk Function`**
```js

const deleteProduct = (id) => {
  return async (dispatch, getState) => {
    
    const res = await fetch(`https://server-for-redux-emajon.vercel.app/delete_product/${id}`, {
      method:"DELETE",
      headers : {
        'Content-type' : "application/json"
      }
    });
    const data = await res.json();

    if(data.acknowledged){
      dispatch(removeProduct(id));
    }
  }
};

export default deleteProduct;
```
#### **`PUT Request Thunk Function`**
```js
export const updateProduct = (product, id) => {
  return async(dispatch, getState) => {
     dispatch(loader());
     try{
       const res = await fetch(`https://server-for-redux-emajon.vercel.app/edit_product/${id}`, {
         method:"PUT",
         headers:{
           'Content-Type':"application/json"
         },
         body: JSON.stringify(product)
       });
       const data = await res.json();
       if(data.acknowledged){
         dispatch(editProduct(product));
       };
     }catch(err){
      dispatch(errorDisplay('Failed to Possst!!!'));
     }
  };
};
```
